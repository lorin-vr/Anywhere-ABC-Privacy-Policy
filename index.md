Anywhere ABC is a flashcard app for learning alphabet letters, beginner words and sight words on iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.

The app is relaxed, non-competitive and designed to be used in short bursts. Practise with your young reader anywhere, anytime, as often as you need.

The font used by the app is the Schools Foundation Font, which is the first font Australian children are introduced to in Kindergarten.
